**Binary Tree Implementation for Dictionary Search**

This repository contains an implementation of a binary tree data structure for searching words in a dictionary. The implementation is written in Java and developed using NetBeans 12 IDE.

**Features:**

- **Binary Tree Structure:** The core of the implementation revolves around a binary tree structure optimized for efficient word search operations in a dictionary.

- **Dictionary Search:** Users can efficiently search for words in the implemented dictionary using the binary tree data structure.

- **Java Implementation:** The implementation is written in Java, providing platform independence and ease of use for developers familiar with the language.

- **Developed with NetBeans 12:** The project is developed using NetBeans 12 IDE, allowing for easy management and development of the Java-based implementation.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jjoseph48/java-project.git
   ```

2. Open the project in NetBeans 12 IDE.

3. Run the project to utilize the binary tree implementation for searching words in the dictionary.

**Contributing:**

Contributions to improve the implementation or add new features are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:
